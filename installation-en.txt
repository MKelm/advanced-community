= papaya CMS Advanced Community Installation =

== Preamble ==

This manual is written for a papaya CMS default installation. The templates
in this module package are created for a papaya CMS default theme.

== Copy files ==

The files in this package are sorted by each papaya CMS folder. It is sufficient to copy the
main foder to the base directory of papaya CMS. If papaya-data and papaya-lib are located in an
external directory, you have to copy the package folders to there.

=== Patches ===

The package contains a set of patches for the existing papaya CMS files in the "pachtes" directory.

To patch your papaya CMS you have to go to command line and execute the following command:
- patch -p 0 < /path/to/package/patches/papayacms.patches

Replace papayacms.patches by this:
- trunk_r38500.patches if you use a nightly build
- release_r38112.patches if you use the 5.5.2 release build

If you cannot perform this patch process, you can download a patched version of papaya CMS here:
https://github.com/MKelm/papaya-cms/archive/master.zip

== Configure the action dispatcher ==

The action dispatcher should be configured to handle deleted data of surfers and pages correctly
in the Advanced Community modules.

Please read the action dispatcher manual too:
http://en.wiki.papaya-cms.com/wiki/Action_Dispatcher

=== Delete surfer data ===

You need a group "community" and an action "onDeleteSurfer" in the action dispatcher. After that you
can add the observer class "ACommunityConnector" to this action.

The Advanced Community connector performs the following actions if a surfer gets deleted:
- Page comments get a flag that the surfer has been deleted
-- The comments list shows a defined surfer name like "Deleted user" after that
-- The commenters ranking box ignores deleted surfers
- Comments for the deleted surfer get deleted
- Surfer galleries with all folders, images and image comments get deleted
-- The corresponding timestamps of last images change get deleted
- Messages of the deleted surfer get deleted
- The timestamp of surfer's last change gets deleted

=== Delete page data ===

You need a group "system" and an action "onDeletePages". Then you can add the observer class
"ACommunityConnector" to this action.

The Advanced Community connector performs the following actions if pages get deleted:
- Page comments of the deleted pages get deleted
- The timestamp of the last page comments change gets deleted

== Page links ==

To link e.g. surfers in boxes and pages correctly you have to set the page ids by module options
in the connector module. Many Advanced Community modules use these options to generate page links.
You need the page modules corresponding to the page id options first, see "Configure pages and boxes".

Change module options, e.g. for "Surfer Page" and "Surfer Gallery Page":
- Open the module overview in the backen menu item "Modules"
- Open the module package "Advanced Community"
- Choose the module "Connector"
- Choose the menu item "Options" on the right upper side
- Set the Option "Page IDs" -> "Surfer" and "Page IDs" -> "Surfer Gallery"
- After that you can reach the surfer page in comment boxes
-- Example URL: infis-page.70.de.html?acs:surfer_handle=infi
- After that you can reach the surfer gallery page in the gallery teaser box
-- Example URL: infis-gallery.71.de.html?acg:surfer_handle=infi

You can set the parameter group of the surfer page too. You will need another parameter group only
if you use another page module than "Surfer Page". This options allows you e.g. to use the
"Show user" module of the community package with the parameter group "bab".

There are some more page ID settings in the connector's module options:
- Login Page = Page ID of the login page, used by "Surfer Status Box"
- Registration Page = Page ID of the registration page, used by "Surfer Status Box"
- Editor Page = Page ID of the profile / editor page, used by "Surfer Status Box"
- Contacts Page = Page ID of contacts page, used by "Surfer Status Box"
- Messages / Notification Page = Page ID of messages page
-- used by "Surfer Status Box" to link "Messages" and "Notifications"
-- used by "Message Conversations Box" for links
- Notification Settings Page = Page ID of the notification settings page
-- used by "Surfer Status Box"

== Notifications ==

To use notifications, you have to import the files from the "import-data" folder to your database:
- Open the papaya CMS backend and go to menu item "Moduels", Packages -> "Advanced Community" and
  choose the table "papaya_acommunity_notifications"
- Go to the menu item "Import data" on the upper right side
- Choose the corresponding CSV file from the "import-data" folder
- Confirm the upload form
- Choose the table "papaya_acommunity_notification_trans"
- Go to the menu item "Import data" on the upper right side
- Choose the corresponding CSV file from the "import-data" folder
- Confirm the upload form

After that the modules will send notifications by message. The delivery of notifications by email
is disabled by default.

But you can change this default behaviour by changing module options in the Advanced Community connector:
- Sender E-Mail, an email address used as sender address for email notifications
- Sender Name, a name used as sender name for email notifications
- Notify By Message, notifications for new surfers by message as default yes/no
- Notify By E-Mail, notifications for new surfers by email as default yes/no

There are three notifications which get supported:
- new-surfer-comment, if another surfer posts a new comment on a surfer page
- new-surfer-image-comment, if another surfer posts a image comment in the surfer's gallery
- new-contact-request, if a surfer requests a contact on another surfer

The settings to deliver notification can be changed by each surfer on a "Notification Settings Page".

== Performance / Caching ==

You can improve the performance of your community page by caching pages and boxes.
You can find the cache settings in the backend menu item "Settings" -> "Options" -> "Cache".
A description of the options is here: http://goo.gl/aYPK6

I recommend to set PAPAYA_CACHE_BOXES = on and PAPAYA_CACHE_PAGES = on.
You should set the cache time settings for each page and box individually.

If you can install php modules, i recommend to install the APC extension and to set
PAPAYA_CACHE_SERVICE = APC. Also see http://goo.gl/aYPK6 and http://php.net/manual/en/book.apc.php

=== Caching Community ===

It is not recommend to cache the login-, registration and profile page, because these modules
load and save data dynamically.

=== Caching Advanced Community ===

Most of the modules support a hight cache time, because the cache content will be resetted
automatically if some data get changed. If your community has a high user acitivity, the real
cache times can be much lesser than the following suggestions. High cache times are great for
areas with a low surfer activity but a high hit count.

Here is a list of suggestions for cache time by module:

- Surfer Page
-- E.g. 604800 seconds
-- The page detects a surfer request change
-- The page detects a change of contact status between the active and selected surfer
-- The page detects a change of surfer's data
-- The caching will be disabled on command parameters to allow repeated changes of the surfer's
   contact status

- Surfer Editor Page
-- The cache will be disabled by default, because data will be loaded and saved dynamically

- Surfer Status Box
-- E.g. 604800 seconds
-- The box detects changes of relevant data
--- Observes the current surfer and changes in contacts

- Commenters Ranking Box
-- E.g. 1800 seconds
-- The box does not detect changes of relevant data, because the computing of changes would be to
   extensive
--- You can set a lower cache time to get a better up-to-dateness, choose for yourself how far you
    change this setting

- Page/Surfer/Image Comments Box
-- E.g. 604800 seconds
-- The cache will be disabled for surfers with login, because the reply form needs a valid token
-- Cache for all surfers without active login
--- The box detects changes of relevant data
---- Observes ressource type (page/surfer/image), ressource id, timestamp of last comments' change
---- Observes parameter command, comment_id and all comment_page parameters

-- Comments Ranking Box
-- E.g. 604800 seconds
-- The box detects changes of comments to refresh the cache content

- Surfer Contacts Page
-- E.g. 604800 seconds
-- The box detects changes of relevant data
--- Observes the current active surfer and the last change time of all contact types
--- Observes the parameter command, surfer_handle and all ..._list_page parameters
--- The caching will be disabled on command parameter to allow contact status changes

- Surfer Contacts Box
-- E.g. 604800 seconds
-- The box detects changes of relevant data
--- Observes the current selected surfer, the last change time of surfer's contacts and the
    parameter contacts_list_page
-- You can change the constant PAPAYA_ACOMMUNITY_CACHE_CONTACTS_BOX_USE_LAST_CHANGE_TIME to 0 in
   papaya-lib/modules/externale/ACommunity/Surfers/Box.php if you use the box without paging and
   if the actuallity of the contents is less important. On active option the module will ignore
   the last change time of contacts. In this mode changes of the list do not have any effect on the
   cached output.
--- In this case you should set the cache time to e.g. 1800 seconds, to get a relative current content

- Surfers Last Action Box
-- E.g. 604800 seconds
-- This box detects changes of relevant data
--- Observes th last timestamp of the surfer property "lastaction"
    and the parameter lastaction_list_page
-- Depending on the activity rate of the whole community the update rate of this box can be very high,
   or follow the next point to get a lesser update rate
-- You can change the constant PAPAYA_ACOMMUNITY_CACHE_LAST_ACTIONS_BOX_USE_LAST_TIME to 0 in
   papaya-lib/modules/externale/ACommunity/Surfers/Box.php if you use the box without paging and
   if the actuallity of the contents is less important. On active option the module will ignore
   the last action time. In this mode changes of the list do not have any effect on the
   cached output.
--- In this case you should set the cache time to e.g. 300 seconds, to get a relative current content

- Surfers Registrations Box
-- E.g. 604800 seconds
-- This box detects changes of relevant data
--- Observes th last timestamp of the surfer property "registration"
    and the parameter registration_list_page
-- Depending on the activity rate of the whole community the update rate of this box can be high,
   or follow the next point to get a lesser update rate
-- You can change the constant PAPAYA_ACOMMUNITY_CACHE_REGISTRATIONS_BOX_USE_LAST_TIME to 0 in
   papaya-lib/modules/externale/ACommunity/Surfers/Box.php if you use the box without paging and
   if the actuallity of the contents is less important. On active option the module will ignore
   the last registration time. In this mode changes of the list do not have any effect on the
   cached output.
--- In this case you should set the cache time to e.g. 1800 seconds, to get a relative current content

- Surfer Gallery Page
-- E.g. 604800 seconds
-- The caching will be disabled on parameter command to perform changes on gallery data
-- The caching detects changes of relevant data
--- Observes current selected surfer, current selected folder, the last change timestamp of images
    in the selected folder and the parameters index, offset, enlarge

- Surfer Gallery Folders Box
-- E.g. 604800 seconds
-- The cache will be disabled if a active surfer corresponds to the selected surfer and the command
   "Add folder" has been performed, because the form to add needs a valid token
-- Otherwise the cache is active and observes changes of relevant data
--- Observes the last change time of gallery folders and the parameters command and folder_id

- Surfer Gallery Upload Box
-- E.g. 604800 seconds
-- The cache will be disabled, if the upload form appears, because it needs a valid token
-- Otherwise the cache ist active, but the benefit of an active cache in this module is small

- Surfer Gallery Teaser Box
-- E.g. 604800 seconds
-- Caching observes the selected surfer and the last change time of images in the base folder,
   additionally it observes if the current surfer is the owner of the gallery

- Message Conversations Box
-- E.g. 604800 seconds
-- This box detects changes of relevant data
--- Observes the current active surfer and the timestamp of the last conversation

- Messages Page
-- E.g. 604800 seconds
-- The cache will be disabled for messages between surfers view, because the reply form needs
   a valid token
-- The cache will be activated for notification (messages) view
--- This view mode detects changes of relevant data
--- Observes the current active surfer, the timestamp of the last notification and the parameter
    messages_page

- Notification Settings Page
-- The cache will be disabled by default, because the module loads and save data dynamically

== URL processing in text ==

Text contents in comments and messages are filtered automatically.
In this process URLs get identified and linked:
- Regular URLs get an a-tag
- Image URLs get an a-tag too
-- but optional you can activate "Text Thumnails" in "Modules" -> Packages: "Advanced Community"
   -> Module: "Connector" -> "Options"
--- In this mode the comment / message content gets Thumbnails of the Image URLs additionally.
    These thumbnails will be displayed below the text content after that.
